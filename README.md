# Simons-Says-Game
Simon Says is a classic memory game where the system shows a sequence of colors, and the user must repeat the sequence in the correct order. With each level, the sequence grows longer. This version was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on core logic and user interaction without using sound or animations.
